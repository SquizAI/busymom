# Subscription Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Context Import Error
- Fixed incorrect import path in Subscribe.jsx from `../contexts/AuthContext` to `../context/UserContext`
- Changed hook usage from `useAuth()` to `useContext(UserContext)`
- Updated imports to include `useContext` from React

### Stripe Integration Issues
- Removed duplicate Stripe initialization in Subscribe.jsx (keeping only the one in CheckoutForm.jsx)
- Added proper error handling for Stripe initialization with `.catch()` handler
- Created mock API implementation in `mockStripeApi.js` for development

### User Object Structure
- Updated user object references to match UserContext structure
- Changed `user?.subscription?.tier` to `user?.planType` in Subscribe.jsx

### Error Handling & Loading States
- Added ErrorBoundary component around Stripe components
- Created LoadingSpinner component for consistent loading UI
- Created SkeletonLoader component for better loading states
- Added proper loading states in CheckoutForm and PlanComparison components
- Improved error messaging for users

## New Components Created
1. **ErrorBoundary.jsx**: Catches and displays errors gracefully
2. **LoadingSpinner.jsx**: Consistent loading indicator across the app
3. **SkeletonLoader.jsx**: Content placeholders during loading
4. **mockStripeApi.js**: Mock implementation of Stripe API endpoints

## Files Modified
1. **src/pages/Subscribe.jsx**
   - Fixed context import
   - Removed duplicate Stripe initialization
   - Updated user object structure
   - Added error boundary around checkout form
   - Improved loading states

2. **src/components/subscription/CheckoutForm.jsx**
   - Added proper error handling for Stripe initialization
   - Integrated with mock API implementation
   - Improved loading state handling
   - Fixed user object structure

3. **src/context/StripeContext.jsx**
   - Updated to use mock API implementation
   - Improved error handling
   - Added proper loading state management

4. **src/components/subscription/PlanComparison.jsx**
   - Added loading state with skeleton loaders
   - Maintained consistent styling during loading

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual backend API endpoints for Stripe operations
2. Add webhook handling for subscription events
3. Implement proper subscription management in the backend
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
5. Test the subscription flow end-to-end

## Testing
The subscription page should now work in development mode with the mock API implementation. Users can:
- View different subscription plans
- Select a plan
- Go through the checkout process
- See appropriate loading and error states
