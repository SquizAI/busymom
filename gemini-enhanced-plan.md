# BusyWomen Gemini 2.5 Enhanced Plan

## Overview

This development plan outlines how to enhance the BusyWomen application's paid plans using Gemini 2.5 models with structured output. The plan leverages the latest capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash models to create a premium AI-powered experience for paid subscribers.

## Current Implementation Analysis

The application currently uses Gemini models for:
- Generating meal recommendations
- Analyzing food preferences
- Creating shopping lists

However, the implementation has several limitations:
1. Not using structured output schema configuration
2. Limited differentiation between free and paid tiers
3. Not leveraging the full capabilities of Gemini 2.5 models
4. Basic error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. Limited personalization capabilities

## Gemini 2.5 Capabilities to Leverage

### Key Model Features
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview**: Advanced reasoning, multimodal understanding, 1M token context window
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview**: Cost-efficient model with strong performance, 1M token context window

### Advanced Features
1. **Structured Output**: Enforce specific JSON schemas for consistent, reliable responses
2. **Function Calling**: Define functions that the model can suggest calling
3. **Code Execution**: Allow the model to execute code for complex calculations
4. **Search Grounding**: Ground responses in search results for up-to-date information
5. **Thinking**: Enable step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks

## Paid Plan Enhancement Strategy

### Tier Structure
1. **Basic Plan (Free)**
   - Limited meal planning with Gemini Flash model

## Technical Implementation Details

### Structured Output Implementation

For each Gemini API call, we'll implement proper schema definitions. Example for meal recommendations:

```javascript
// Premium meal recommendation with structured output
export const generatePremiumMealRecommendations = async (preferences, userProfile) => {
  try {
    const model = getGeminiProModel();
    
    // Create context from user profile and preferences
    const userContext = createUserContext(preferences, userProfile);
    
    const result = await model.generateContent({
      contents: [{
        role: 'user',
        parts: [{
          text: `Generate a personalized weekly meal plan for a busy woman with the following preferences:
          ${formatPreferences(preferences)}
          
          Consider these additional factors from their profile:
          ${formatUserProfile(userProfile)}
          
          Create a complete 7-day meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day.`
        }]
      }],
